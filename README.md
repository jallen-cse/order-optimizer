# Order Optimizer
OpenCV &amp; PyTesseract driven order optimizer for kitchen staff.

This optimizer simplifies the food preperation process in a line kitchen.  Chefs are able to reference a single queue rather than parsing dozens of paper tickets to determine what needs to be sold.  This greatly reduces the cost of wasted product due to preperation errors while increasing the rate of output per kitchen staff.
